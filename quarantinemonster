(INTRO START)
Once upon a time there was a girl named Jennie who lived in Madison. She attended University of Wisconsin-Madison and it was her first year. 
Jennie really enjoyed her first year so far; she expected college to be super intimidating because her teachers portrayed professors as very strict individuals, but to her pleasant surprise all of her professors were pretty friendly!
Jennie made a lot of new friends in the span of the first week and she had a lot of fun exploring the campus with them - everyday there was a new surprise for her friend group! 
She especially enjoyed taking walks on State Street and visiting Mem U to get the best ice cream. 
Until the biggest surprise hit them on a pleasant spring day .... hearing that they will have to go home for the rest of the semester because of Covid-19 :(
