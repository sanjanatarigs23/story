(INTRO START)
Once upon a time there was a girl named Jennie who lived in Madison. She attended University of Wisconsin-Madison and it was her first year. 
Jennie really enjoyed her first year so far; she expected college to be super intimidating because her teachers portrayed professors as very strict individuals, but to her pleasant surprise all of her professors were pretty friendly!
Jennie made a lot of new friends in the span of the first week and she had a lot of fun exploring the campus with them - everyday there was a new surprise for her friend group! 
She especially enjoyed taking walks on State Street and visiting Mem U to get the best ice cream. 
Until the biggest surprise hit them on a pleasant spring day .... hearing that they will have to go home for the rest of the semester because of Covid-19 :(

Jennie was pretty upset to have to go back home when she finally got so used to university life. The day to say goodbye to her friends came, 2 months earlier than expected, and she embraced everyone one of them before leaving hoem.
The road was long but Jennie and her dad managed to make it back to her small town she grew up in before midnight that day. She took her bags back to her bedroom and just went to bed deciding to unpack the next morning.
Jennie's first week back home was also spring break and due to the lockdown she had little to do and so she tried to keep incontact with her friend group. 
Spring break while uneventful went by quickly and classes started again. Most of Jennie's classes opted to present pre recorded lectures that the students can view any time they like.
While at first it seemed to be pretty convenient to have lectures available at any time Jennie quickly realised that if she wasn't careful lectures can pile up fast.
Being at home was not the best motivational environment to work at her best ans so she needed a plan to not fall behind.
